# Flair Comment Finder (Reddit Bot)
This Bot is designed to find new comments with a specific flair (specified by the programmer) and makes a sticky comment in the thread the comments with the flair were made, linking to the comments it found. It also edits the comment it made and adds the links to the new comments that were made after the posting of the initial comment.
